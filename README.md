Movie Recommendation System
This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Python, TMDb API, and
Streamlit. It fetches real-time movie data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API and
provides personalized movie recommendations using collaborative and content-
based filtering techniques. Users can input a movie title or their preferences through
an intuitive Streamlit interface, and the system displays recommended movies along
with posters and details fetched from TMDb. Key Python libraries include Pandas,
NumPy, Scikit-learn, Requests, and Streamlit. This project can be easily extended for
deployment as a web application to enhance user experience and interactivity.
